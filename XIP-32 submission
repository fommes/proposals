# Proposal Summary

The following tweet from Infinex official X account suggests to

https://x.com/infinex_app/status/1796693183642149094
 
Vote for who should receive a share of 30M GP from the 'GP Retirement Fund

This proposal lines out how on to better create a vote which involves only commited community members with "skin in the game"

# Specification

Now, how about to make such a vote just available to:

a) NFT holders of mentioned communities

b) Infinex community members

I'd suggest to enable the vote within Infinex Discord, which would tick both of the above criteria and also incentivise 1 vote per 1 person, instead of 1 vote per wallet holding the NFTs (holders could distribute to multiple wallets)

To identify holders, Discord bots have to be added:

-Guild or Collabland for EVM
-Matrica Verification for Solana

## Overview

This XIP tries to address distribution of GP to exclusively very aligned community members.

## Rationale

Votes on Twitter can easily be botted or just soliciting non community members to vote favourable and should not be indicative.

## Technical Specification

not applicable. 

## Test Cases

not applicaple.

# Copyright

not applicaple.
