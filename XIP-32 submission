The following tweet from Infinex official X account suggests to

Vote for who should receive a share of 30M GP from the 'GP Retirement Fund

Now, how about to make such a vote just available to:

a) NFT holders of mentioned communities

b) Infinex community members

I'd suggest to enable the vote within Infinex Discord, which would tick both of the above criteria and also incentivise 1 vote per 1 person, instead of 1 vote per wallet holding the NFTs (holders could distribute to multiple wallets)

To identify holders, Discord bots have to be added:

-Guild or Collabland for EVM
-Matrica Verification for Solana
